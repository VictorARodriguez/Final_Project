PLANNING & DELIVERABLES
Project Plan deliverables:
•	Scope. 
What are you planning to build?
Pocket 'LLERO [pronounced: yeh-ro]. It's the mobile digital space for Latino men. We deliver news, knowledge and advice to men who have their feet firmly planted in both American and their traditional cultures. 'LLERO understands the challenges of balancing mainstream and traditional values, the drive for professional and personal growth and the need to have it all at your fingertips. So whether you're interested in the top March Madness picks, news from your home patria, or tips on choosing the right suit for a job interview, 'LLERO is where you'll find it. More than just beer, babes and gadgets (although we bring you that too). `LLERO provides useful, culturally relevant content to read, watch and share with friends.

What features will it have?
MVP involves: (i) user log-in/profile, (ii) user authentication, (iii) the ability to view different content offerings; and (iv) utilize FourSquare API; (iv) responsive design components

What do you think you can reasonably implement in the time period?
MVP, Foursquare API and responsive design elements seem achievable within one week period provided. Should time allow will also look to implement additional features such as ability to curate articles for personalized version of publication. These additional features currently reside in Icebox card on Trello.
